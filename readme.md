# Panenco Node Course

Throughout this course we will gradually build a Node.js Express API that manages a single entity: `Users`. As we progress, elements, techniques and libraries will be added to the project.

The end goal is to build a CRUD (create, read, update, delete) controller based on [papi](https://npmjs.com/package/@panenco/papi). The way API's are built at Panenco.

The course consists of 3 main parts: Module 1, 2 and 3. Each part builds on top of the previous one.

-   [Module 0](./content-module0.md)

    > Setup your dev environment.

-   [Module 1](./content-module1.md)

    > Create a very basic NodeJS Express API.

-   [Module 2](./content-module2.md)

    > Transform the API to typescript with input/output validation and automated tests.

-   [Module 3](./content-module3.md)

    > Transform the API to the Panenco way of working with [papi](https://npmjs.com/package/@panenco/papi) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).)

When this is all done you should have gained the skills to extend it on your own. There will be an example product you can build with the result of module 3 as a starting point.

ðŸš€ Happy coding!
